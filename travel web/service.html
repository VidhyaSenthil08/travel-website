          <h2>Romantic Travel</h2>
<p>Planning the perfect honeymoon? A once in a lifetime trip to celebrate your engagement? Or just want to get away from it all and have some time together? We ll take all the stress of organization off your hands, leaving you to concentrate on what really matters: each other.
We specialize in trips to some of the most romantic destinations in the world. Our experiences are guaranteed to send hearts soaring. Think gourmet meals by the Caribbean sea, taking in the sunset together from the deck of a ship, or slow-dancing beneath the stars at an open-air party.
<h2>Family Travel</h2>
As rewarding as it can be, travelling with kids is exhausting. But with the help of world Exclusive Travel, you wont have to worry about a thing except having fun, bonding, and enjoying those all important shared moments that are the building blocks of your familys identity.
With expertise in organizing Disneyland adventures as well as trips to a whole range of family 
friendly destinations, we can work with you to build your ideal family vacation block by block. Our goal is to make sure every traveler, no matter how young or old, comes back from their trip with a smile on their face.
<h2>Group Travel</h2>
Traveling in a larger group can be incredibly fun. It can also be incredibly challenging. Balancing the needs and wants of many different personalities, making sure everyone is in the right place at the right time, and finding an acceptable budget can quickly make your vacation feel more like work.
Not only will we look after every single one of those potentially divisive details, we will take great pleasure in doing it. When you travel with us, every single member of your group will have their perspectives taken into account.
And its not enough for us simply to schedule travel experiences that suit your group. We ll support you every step of the way, making sure everyones happy, and offering expert solutions if they arent. With friction kept to an absolute minimum, you can relax and make the most of the sun, sand and sea together.
<h2>Cruises</h2>
With our founder, Felicia Thomas, having experience of dozens of cruises and being a certified
Carnival Cruise Specialist, we know a thing or two about sailing the seven seas. Whether its a
romantic trip, a family trip or just a general escape from reality that you are after, boarding a ship is one of the most exciting ways of getting there. On a cruise, transport becomes part of the
adventure, rather than a practicality to get out of the way.
Our cruise partners are some of the best in the business, providing upscale dining options and
accommodation that will make every moment of your journey a pleasure. Swap that cramped
airplane seat for a sun lounger on deck as you discover the pristine sands and turquoise waters of the Bahamas, the Cayman Islands and many more  and all with a cocktail in your hand.
<h2>Destination Weddings</h2>
We know every detail counts in organizing a wedding. When it comes to one of the most important days of your life, theres no such thing as simply good enough. Only the very best will do. Every couple wants a wedding that delights and surprises, that makes for gorgeous photos and precious memories, and, above all, that captures the unique magic of their love.
Let us put our expert knowledge to the best possible use, by bringing you the fairytale wedding
you have always fantasized about. From Mexico to Jamaica, from Cozumel to Haiti, our repertoire of enchanting destinations offers something for every couple.
Maybe you see yourself getting married on the beach at sunset, with the sound of the waves providing background music. Or maybe you envision your wedding day as an all-out, colorful, flower filled fiesta in a sun-soaked location. No matter what you have in mind, the first step to making it happen is simple: get in touch with us.</p>
